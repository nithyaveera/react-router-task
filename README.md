### React Router
Set up React Router to enable navigation between different categories. See `App.jsx` and `Navcomp.jsx` for implementation.

### Filtering Cards
Cards are filtered based on the selected category. Each category has its own component (e.g., `FullstackComp`) responsible for filtering and displaying cards.
